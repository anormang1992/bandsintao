Not an impressive introduction to the Chili Peppers for my 13 year old son.

The absence of John Fruscante is still felt, especially when the current guitarist tried to play Stadium Arcadium songs; he was more flash than true substance. I'd love to see how they'd sound if the Orleans Street Guitarist was in the band!</div></div><div class="ratings-cdbf6123">View More Fan Reviews</div></div></div><div
