bass\nMatthew Followill, lead guitar\nNathan Followill, drums","bioText":"When Kings of Leon released their third album Because Of The Times in April 2007, Entertainment Weekly called it their ‚Äúcrowning achievement,‚Äù while Rolling Stone wondered: ‚ÄúHow good can the Kings of Leon get? They‚Äôve already gone further than anybody could have guessed.‚Äù  Coming as it did on the heels of 2003‚Äôs rowdy Youth and Young Manhood and 2005‚Äôs brawny Aha Shake Heartbreak, the expansive Because of The Times was indeed a pivotal and game-changing album. It led the Followills ‚Äî Tennessee-bred Caleb, Nathan, and Jared, and their cousin Matthew ‚Äî to astonishing success around the world. In the U.S., the band has sold out New York City‚Äôs fabled Radio City Music Hall and The Greek Theatre in Hollywood. In the U.K., Kings of Leon headlined this summer‚Äôs legendary Glastonbury Festival, as well as the Oxygen Festival in Ireland, and sold out their upcoming December show at London‚Äôs 20,000-seat 02  Arena (where Led Zeppelin held its reunion concert) in less than an hour. But if critics thought that Because of The Times was the work of a band ‚Äúat the peak of its powers‚Äù (as the Los Angeles Times put it), they may want to reconsider that assessment after hearing Kings of Leon‚Äôs new album Only By The Night, due from RCA Records on September 23rd. Only By The Night picks up where Because of The Times left off, continuing Kings of Leon‚Äôs shape-shifting evolution and cementing their status as a world-class rock band.‚ÄúAfter three records and touring for five years straight, we knew what we were capable of,‚Äù says the band‚Äôs drummer Nathan, ‚Äúwe just had to put our money where our mouths were. We had to take it to the next level. You always want your next record to be better than your last.‚Äù Adds frontman and lyricist Caleb: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never a time that we‚Äôll make a record and won‚Äôt attempt to do something better than what came before.‚ÄùWith its stunning melodies, ringing guitars, and razor-sharp grooves, Only By The Night delivers on the promise Kings of Leon have shown throughout their career. From the desolate atmospherics of the opening track ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù (which Caleb says is about a lovesick vampire) to the emotional intensity of the closing ballad ‚ÄúCold Desert‚Äù (‚Äúabout a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up‚Äù), Only By The Night is all heart from start to finish. Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes. It was really a big family vibe. That‚Äôs where the title comes from. It‚Äôs also a reference to a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, and it has five syllables, like all of our album titles.‚Äù Caleb had written most of the lyrics and melodies for Only By The Night during some downtime at home recovering from shoulder surgery. ‚ÄúI think the pain pills inspired him a little more than he realized,‚Äù Nathan says with a laugh. ‚ÄúHe would play us a song and we‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòWhen did you write that?‚Äô and he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt really remember writing it. I just woke up with an empty bottle of wine and my songbook open and these words written down.‚Äô‚Äù Says Caleb: ‚ÄúThose pills can make you feel so nice. I think a lot of the pretty melodies came from that and from me just opening more.‚Äù Another influence could be their experiences playing arenas, not only in support of Because Of The Times, but while opening for U2 in 2005 and Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam in 2006 and 2008. ‚ÄúWe definitely wanted the songs to sound good in a 15,000-seat venue, but we also wanted them to have the kind of intimacy that would get the point across at a club show for 300 kids,‚Äù Nathan says.Overall, the Followills knew it was time to be honest about their ambitions and prove what they could really do. Caleb, for one, unleashes some of the most righteous, anguished singing he‚Äôs ever recorded. ‚ÄúI knew it was a risk for me to go in there and really open up and belt the way that I know that I can; the way that I used to when I was younger,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI just hid my singing for so long because I was nervous that people would listen to my lyrics, assume I wasn‚Äôt intelligent because I‚Äôm from Tennessee, and pick me apart, so that‚Äôs why I sang the way I did. But going into this, I knew these melodies that we were playing were too beautiful for me to fuck it up. I had to go for it.‚Äù ‚ÄúBasically we got the point where we realized that we can be known as a band that hit it hard for three records and disappeared, or be a band that was smart enough to realize that not very many bands get to make four records, so let‚Äôs make the most of this,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúBecause honestly, we were horrible housepainters and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd be doing if we weren‚Äôt doing this!‚Äù","shouldRenderSeparator":true,"genreContent":"Rock","genreTitle":"Genres: ","hometownContent":null,"hometownTitle":"Hometown: ","links":[],"sectionHeading":"About Kings of

Kongos opened the show as the sun set. They rocked it! They got everyone on their feet and dancing and loved being there as much as we loved it. Young the Giant kept the crowd on their feet and dancing. When Kings of Leon took the stage the crowed was in a frenzy. They opened the show with Supersoaker and played a 2 hour set of 24 songs including Arizona as Denver's 'Song  for the City' and closed with Sex On Fire. This was one of my favorite Red Rock concerts and I can't wait to see Kongos heading their own show at Red Rocks in the next few years and for the next electrifying Kings of Leon performance.","venueName":"RED ROCKS AMPHITHEATRE","venueUrl":null,"venueLocation":"Morrison, CO","venueCityUrl":"https://www.bandsintown.com/c/morrison-co?came_from=251","date":"September 1st 2014","viewMore":"View more","viewLess":"View less","starImages":{"teal":"https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/tealStar.svg","half":"https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/halfStar.svg","gray":"https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/grayStar.svg"}},{"name":null,"userImageUrl":"https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png","fallbackImageUrl":"https://assets.bandsintown.com/images/fallbackImage.png","rating":5,"comment":"All three bands were really good.

Stone wondered: ‚ÄúHow good can the Kings of Leon get? They‚Äôve already gone further than anybody could have guessed.‚Äù  Coming as it did on the heels of 2003‚Äôs rowdy Youth and Young Manhood and 2005‚Äôs brawny Aha Shake Heartbreak, the expansive Because of The Times was indeed a pivotal and game-changing album. It led the Followills ‚Äî Tennessee-bred Caleb, Nathan, and Jared, and their cousin Matthew ‚Äî to astonishing success around the world. In the U.S., the band has sold out New York City‚Äôs fabled Radio City Music Hall and The Greek Theatre in Hollywood. In the U.K., Kings of Leon headlined this summer‚Äôs legendary Glastonbury Festival, as well as the Oxygen Festival in Ireland, and sold out their upcoming December show at London‚Äôs 20,000-seat 02  Arena (where Led Zeppelin held its reunion concert) in less than an hour. But if critics thought that Because of The Times was the work of a band ‚Äúat the peak of its powers‚Äù (as the Los Angeles Times put it), they may want to reconsider that assessment after hearing Kings of Leon‚Äôs new album Only By The Night, due from RCA Records on September 23rd. Only By The Night picks up where Because of The Times left off, continuing Kings of Leon‚Äôs shape-shifting evolution and cementing their status as a world-class rock band.‚ÄúAfter three records and touring for five years straight, we knew what we were capable of,‚Äù says the band‚Äôs drummer Nathan, ‚Äúwe just had to put our money where our mouths were. We had to take it to the next level. You always want your next record to be better than your last.‚Äù Adds frontman and lyricist Caleb: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never a time that we‚Äôll make a record and won‚Äôt attempt to do something better than what came before.‚ÄùWith its stunning melodies, ringing guitars, and razor-sharp grooves, Only By The Night delivers on the promise Kings of Leon have shown throughout their career. From the desolate atmospherics of the opening track ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù (which Caleb says is about a lovesick vampire) to the emotional intensity of the closing ballad ‚ÄúCold Desert‚Äù (‚Äúabout a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up‚Äù), Only By The Night is all heart from start to finish. Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes. It was really a big family vibe. That‚Äôs where the title comes from. It‚Äôs also a reference to a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, and it has five syllables, like all of our album titles.‚Äù Caleb had written most of the lyrics and melodies for Only By The Night during some downtime at home recovering from shoulder surgery. ‚ÄúI think the pain pills inspired him a little more than he realized,‚Äù Nathan says with a laugh. ‚ÄúHe would play us a song and we‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòWhen did you write that?‚Äô and he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt really remember writing it. I just woke up with an empty bottle of wine and my songbook open and these words written down.‚Äô‚Äù Says Caleb: ‚ÄúThose pills can make you feel so nice. I think a lot of the pretty melodies came from that and from me just opening more.‚Äù Another influence could be their experiences playing arenas, not only in support of Because Of The Times, but while opening for U2 in 2005 and Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam in 2006 and 2008. ‚ÄúWe definitely wanted the songs to sound good in a 15,000-seat venue, but we also wanted them to have the kind of intimacy that would get the point across at a club show for 300 kids,‚Äù Nathan says.Overall, the Followills knew it was time to be honest about their ambitions and prove what they could really do. Caleb, for one, unleashes some of the most righteous, anguished singing he‚Äôs ever recorded. ‚ÄúI knew it was a risk for me to go in there and really open up and belt the way that I know that I can; the way that I used to when I was younger,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI just hid my singing for so long because I was nervous that people would listen to my lyrics, assume I wasn‚Äôt intelligent because I‚Äôm from Tennessee, and pick me apart, so that‚Äôs why I sang the way I did. But going into this, I knew these melodies that we were playing were too beautiful for me to fuck it up. I had to go for it.‚Äù ‚ÄúBasically we got the point where we realized that we can be known as a band that hit it hard for three records and disappeared, or be a band that was smart enough to realize that not very many bands get to make four records, so let‚Äôs make the most of this,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúBecause honestly, we were horrible housepainters and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd be doing if we weren‚Äôt doing this!‚Äù","interactionCount":"2837144 Trackers"},"eventsJsonLd":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicEvent","startDate":"2018-10-12","endDate":"2018-10-12","url":"https://www.bandsintown.com/e/1009792369-kings-of-leon-at-global-event-center-at-winstar-world-casino-and-resort?came_from=244","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Global Event Center at WinStar World Casino and Resort","address":"Thackerville, OK","geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":33.757785,"longitude":-97.132039}},"name":"Kings of Leon plays Global Event Center at WinStar World Casino and Resort","performer":{"@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Kings of Leon","image":"https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7649867.jpeg","url":"https://www.bandsintown.com/a/983-kings-of-leon?came_from=244"},"description":"Kings of Leon plays Global Event Center at WinStar World Casino and Resort","image":"https://photos.bandsintown.com/thumb/7649867.jpeg","offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.bandsintown.com/t/1009792369?came_from=244","availability":"InStock","price":"0","priceCurrency":"unknown","validFrom":"2018-09-04T18:22:34-04:00"}}],"ratingsJsonLd":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","name":"Kings of Leon","genre":"Rock","employees":{"@type":"Person","name":["Caleb Followill","lead vocals rhythm guitar \nJared Followill","bass\nMatthew Followill","lead guitar\nNathan Followill","drums"]},"description":"When Kings of Leon released their third album Because Of The Times in April 2007, Entertainment Weekly called it their ‚Äúcrowning achievement,‚Äù while Rolling Stone wondered: ‚ÄúHow good can the Kings of Leon get?

Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes.

Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes.

You always want your next record to be better than your last.‚Äù Adds frontman and lyricist Caleb: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never a time that we‚Äôll make a record and won‚Äôt attempt to do something better than what came before.‚ÄùWith its stunning melodies, ringing guitars, and razor-sharp grooves, Only By The Night delivers on the promise Kings of Leon have shown throughout their career. From the desolate atmospherics of the opening track ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù (which Caleb says is about a lovesick vampire) to the emotional intensity of the closing ballad ‚ÄúCold Desert‚Äù (‚Äúabout a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up‚Äù), Only By The Night is all heart from start to finish. Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes.

Kongos opened the show as the sun set. They rocked it! They got everyone on their feet and dancing and loved being there as much as we loved it. Young the Giant kept the crowd on their feet and dancing. When Kings of Leon took the stage the crowed was in a frenzy. They opened the show with Supersoaker and played a 2 hour set of 24 songs including Arizona as Denver's 'Song  for the City' and closed with Sex On Fire. This was one of my favorite Red Rock concerts and I can't wait to see Kongos heading their own show at Red Rocks in the next few years and for the next electrifying Kings of Leon performance.

Only By The Night picks up where Because of The Times left off, continuing Kings of Leon‚Äôs shape-shifting evolution and cementing their status as a world-class rock band.‚ÄúAfter three records and touring for five years straight, we knew what we were capable of,‚Äù says the band‚Äôs drummer Nathan, ‚Äúwe just had to put our money where our mouths were. We had to take it to the next level. You always want your next record to be better than your last.‚Äù Adds frontman and lyricist Caleb: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never a time that we‚Äôll make a record and won‚Äôt attempt to do something better than what came before.‚ÄùWith its stunning melodies, ringing guitars, and razor-sharp grooves, Only By The Night delivers on the promise Kings of Leon have shown throughout their career. From the desolate atmospherics of the opening track ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù (which Caleb says is about a lovesick vampire) to the emotional intensity of the closing ballad ‚ÄúCold Desert‚Äù (‚Äúabout a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up‚Äù), Only By The Night is all heart from start to finish. Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes. It was really a big family vibe. That‚Äôs where the title comes from. It‚Äôs also a reference to a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, and it has five syllables, like all of our album titles.‚Äù Caleb had written most of the lyrics and melodies for Only By The Night during some downtime at home recovering from shoulder surgery. ‚ÄúI think the pain pills inspired him a little more than he realized,‚Äù Nathan says with a laugh. ‚ÄúHe would play us a song and we‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòWhen did you write that?‚Äô and he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt really remember writing it. I just woke up with an empty bottle of wine and my songbook open and these words written down.‚Äô‚Äù Says Caleb: ‚ÄúThose pills can make you feel so nice. I think a lot of the pretty melodies came from that and from me just opening more.‚Äù Another influence could be their experiences playing arenas, not only in support of Because Of The Times, but while opening for U2 in 2005 and Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam in 2006 and 2008. ‚ÄúWe definitely wanted the songs to sound good in a 15,000-seat venue, but we also wanted them to have the kind of intimacy that would get the point across at a club show for 300 kids,‚Äù Nathan says.Overall, the Followills knew it was time to be honest about their ambitions and prove what they could really do. Caleb, for one, unleashes some of the most righteous, anguished singing he‚Äôs ever recorded. ‚ÄúI knew it was a risk for me to go in there and really open up and belt the way that I know that I can; the way that I used to when I was younger,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI just hid my singing for so long because I was nervous that people would listen to my lyrics, assume I wasn‚Äôt intelligent because I‚Äôm from Tennessee, and pick me apart, so that‚Äôs why I sang the way I did.

I had to go for it.‚Äù ‚ÄúBasically we got the point where we realized that we can be known as a band that hit it hard for three records and disappeared, or be a band that was smart enough to realize that not very many bands get to make four records, so let‚Äôs make the most of this,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúBecause honestly, we were horrible housepainters and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd be doing if we weren‚Äôt doing this!‚Äù","interactionCount":"2837144 Trackers"},"reviewBody":"Being 15 minutes late on stage don't matter when it's hit after hit song and you can play like they do, Off to Milton Keynes next week to see then again.

Only By The Night picks up where Because of The Times left off, continuing Kings of Leon‚Äôs shape-shifting evolution and cementing their status as a world-class rock band.‚ÄúAfter three records and touring for five years straight, we knew what we were capable of,‚Äù says the band‚Äôs drummer Nathan, ‚Äúwe just had to put our money where our mouths were. We had to take it to the next level. You always want your next record to be better than your last.‚Äù Adds frontman and lyricist Caleb: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never a time that we‚Äôll make a record and won‚Äôt attempt to do something better than what came before.‚ÄùWith its stunning melodies, ringing guitars, and razor-sharp grooves, Only By The Night delivers on the promise Kings of Leon have shown throughout their career. From the desolate atmospherics of the opening track ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù (which Caleb says is about a lovesick vampire) to the emotional intensity of the closing ballad ‚ÄúCold Desert‚Äù (‚Äúabout a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up‚Äù), Only By The Night is all heart from start to finish. Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes. It was really a big family vibe. That‚Äôs where the title comes from. It‚Äôs also a reference to a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, and it has five syllables, like all of our album titles.‚Äù Caleb had written most of the lyrics and melodies for Only By The Night during some downtime at home recovering from shoulder surgery. ‚ÄúI think the pain pills inspired him a little more than he realized,‚Äù Nathan says with a laugh. ‚ÄúHe would play us a song and we‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòWhen did you write that?‚Äô and he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt really remember writing it. I just woke up with an empty bottle of wine and my songbook open and these words written down.‚Äô‚Äù Says Caleb: ‚ÄúThose pills can make you feel so nice. I think a lot of the pretty melodies came from that and from me just opening more.‚Äù Another influence could be their experiences playing arenas, not only in support of Because Of The Times, but while opening for U2 in 2005 and Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam in 2006 and 2008. ‚ÄúWe definitely wanted the songs to sound good in a 15,000-seat venue, but we also wanted them to have the kind of intimacy that would get the point across at a club show for 300 kids,‚Äù Nathan says.Overall, the Followills knew it was time to be honest about their ambitions and prove what they could really do. Caleb, for one, unleashes some of the most righteous, anguished singing he‚Äôs ever recorded. ‚ÄúI knew it was a risk for me to go in there and really open up and belt the way that I know that I can; the way that I used to when I was younger,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI just hid my singing for so long because I was nervous that people would listen to my lyrics, assume I wasn‚Äôt intelligent because I‚Äôm from Tennessee, and pick me apart, so that‚Äôs why I sang the way I did. But going into this, I knew these melodies that we were playing were too beautiful for me to fuck it up. I had to go for it.‚Äù ‚ÄúBasically we got the point where we realized that we can be known as a band that hit it hard for three records and disappeared, or be a band that was smart enough to realize that not very many bands get to make four records, so let‚Äôs make the most of this,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúBecause honestly, we were horrible housepainters and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd be doing if we weren‚Äôt doing this!‚Äù","interactionCount":"2837144 Trackers"},"reviewBody":"The visuals were awesome but I didn't get I see the band a lot because they were a little distracting sometimes.

They‚Äôve already gone further than anybody could have guessed.‚Äù  Coming as it did on the heels of 2003‚Äôs rowdy Youth and Young Manhood and 2005‚Äôs brawny Aha Shake Heartbreak, the expansive Because of The Times was indeed a pivotal and game-changing album. It led the Followills ‚Äî Tennessee-bred Caleb, Nathan, and Jared, and their cousin Matthew ‚Äî to astonishing success around the world. In the U.S., the band has sold out New York City‚Äôs fabled Radio City Music Hall and The Greek Theatre in Hollywood. In the U.K., Kings of Leon headlined this summer‚Äôs legendary Glastonbury Festival, as well as the Oxygen Festival in Ireland, and sold out their upcoming December show at London‚Äôs 20,000-seat 02  Arena (where Led Zeppelin held its reunion concert) in less than an hour. But if critics thought that Because of The Times was the work of a band ‚Äúat the peak of its powers‚Äù (as the Los Angeles Times put it), they may want to reconsider that assessment after hearing Kings of Leon‚Äôs new album Only By The Night, due from RCA Records on September 23rd. Only By The Night picks up where Because of The Times left off, continuing Kings of Leon‚Äôs shape-shifting evolution and cementing their status as a world-class rock band.‚ÄúAfter three records and touring for five years straight, we knew what we were capable of,‚Äù says the band‚Äôs drummer Nathan, ‚Äúwe just had to put our money where our mouths were. We had to take it to the next level. You always want your next record to be better than your last.‚Äù Adds frontman and lyricist Caleb: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never a time that we‚Äôll make a record and won‚Äôt attempt to do something better than what came before.‚ÄùWith its stunning melodies, ringing guitars, and razor-sharp grooves, Only By The Night delivers on the promise Kings of Leon have shown throughout their career. From the desolate atmospherics of the opening track ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù (which Caleb says is about a lovesick vampire) to the emotional intensity of the closing ballad ‚ÄúCold Desert‚Äù (‚Äúabout a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up‚Äù), Only By The Night is all heart from start to finish. Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes. It was really a big family vibe. That‚Äôs where the title comes from. It‚Äôs also a reference to a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, and it has five syllables, like all of our album titles.‚Äù Caleb had written most of the lyrics and melodies for Only By The Night during some downtime at home recovering from shoulder surgery. ‚ÄúI think the pain pills inspired him a little more than he realized,‚Äù Nathan says with a laugh. ‚ÄúHe would play us a song and we‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòWhen did you write that?‚Äô and he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt really remember writing it. I just woke up with an empty bottle of wine and my songbook open and these words written down.‚Äô‚Äù Says Caleb: ‚ÄúThose pills can make you feel so nice. I think a lot of the pretty melodies came from that and from me just opening more.‚Äù Another influence could be their experiences playing arenas, not only in support of Because Of The Times, but while opening for U2 in 2005 and Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam in 2006 and 2008. ‚ÄúWe definitely wanted the songs to sound good in a 15,000-seat venue, but we also wanted them to have the kind of intimacy that would get the point across at a club show for 300 kids,‚Äù Nathan says.Overall, the Followills knew it was time to be honest about their ambitions and prove what they could really do. Caleb, for one, unleashes some of the most righteous, anguished singing he‚Äôs ever recorded. ‚ÄúI knew it was a risk for me to go in there and really open up and belt the way that I know that I can; the way that I used to when I was younger,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI just hid my singing for so long because I was nervous that people would listen to my lyrics, assume I wasn‚Äôt intelligent because I‚Äôm from Tennessee, and pick me apart, so that‚Äôs why I sang the way I did. But going into this, I knew these melodies that we were playing were too beautiful for me to fuck it up. I had to go for it.‚Äù ‚ÄúBasically we got the point where we realized that we can be known as a band that hit it hard for three records and disappeared, or be a band that was smart enough to realize that not very many bands get to make four records, so let‚Äôs make the most of this,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúBecause honestly, we were horrible housepainters and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd be doing if we weren‚Äôt doing this!‚Äù","interactionCount":"2837144 Trackers"}</script>

Taking off a half star because I found the on-screen visuals (abstract video of women's' hands, etc.) a bit distracting from the performance.

They‚Äôve already gone further than anybody could have guessed.‚Äù  Coming as it did on the heels of 2003‚Äôs rowdy Youth and Young Manhood and 2005‚Äôs brawny Aha Shake Heartbreak, the expansive Because of The Times was indeed a pivotal and game-changing album. It led the Followills ‚Äî Tennessee-bred Caleb, Nathan, and Jared, and their cousin Matthew ‚Äî to astonishing success around the world. In the U.S., the band has sold out New York City‚Äôs fabled Radio City Music Hall and The Greek Theatre in Hollywood. In the U.K., Kings of Leon headlined this summer‚Äôs legendary Glastonbury Festival, as well as the Oxygen Festival in Ireland, and sold out their upcoming December show at London‚Äôs 20,000-seat 02  Arena (where Led Zeppelin held its reunion concert) in less than an hour. But if critics thought that Because of The Times was the work of a band ‚Äúat the peak of its powers‚Äù (as the Los Angeles Times put it), they may want to reconsider that assessment after hearing Kings of Leon‚Äôs new album Only By The Night, due from RCA Records on September 23rd. Only By The Night picks up where Because of The Times left off, continuing Kings of Leon‚Äôs shape-shifting evolution and cementing their status as a world-class rock band.‚ÄúAfter three records and touring for five years straight, we knew what we were capable of,‚Äù says the band‚Äôs drummer Nathan, ‚Äúwe just had to put our money where our mouths were. We had to take it to the next level. You always want your next record to be better than your last.‚Äù Adds frontman and lyricist Caleb: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never a time that we‚Äôll make a record and won‚Äôt attempt to do something better than what came before.‚ÄùWith its stunning melodies, ringing guitars, and razor-sharp grooves, Only By The Night delivers on the promise Kings of Leon have shown throughout their career. From the desolate atmospherics of the opening track ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù (which Caleb says is about a lovesick vampire) to the emotional intensity of the closing ballad ‚ÄúCold Desert‚Äù (‚Äúabout a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up‚Äù), Only By The Night is all heart from start to finish. Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes.

It‚Äôs also a reference to a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, and it has five syllables, like all of our album titles.‚Äù Caleb had written most of the lyrics and melodies for Only By The Night during some downtime at home recovering from shoulder surgery. ‚ÄúI think the pain pills inspired him a little more than he realized,‚Äù Nathan says with a laugh. ‚ÄúHe would play us a song and we‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòWhen did you write that?‚Äô and he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt really remember writing it.

It led the Followills ‚Äî Tennessee-bred Caleb, Nathan, and Jared, and their cousin Matthew ‚Äî to astonishing success around the world. In the U.S., the band has sold out New York City‚Äôs fabled Radio City Music Hall and The Greek Theatre in Hollywood. In the U.K., Kings of Leon headlined this summer‚Äôs legendary Glastonbury Festival, as well as the Oxygen Festival in Ireland, and sold out their upcoming December show at London‚Äôs 20,000-seat 02  Arena (where Led Zeppelin held its reunion concert) in less than an hour. But if critics thought that Because of The Times was the work of a band ‚Äúat the peak of its powers‚Äù (as the Los Angeles Times put it), they may want to reconsider that assessment after hearing Kings of Leon‚Äôs new album Only By The Night, due from RCA Records on September 23rd. Only By The Night picks up where Because of The Times left off, continuing Kings of Leon‚Äôs shape-shifting evolution and cementing their status as a world-class rock band.‚ÄúAfter three records and touring for five years straight, we knew what we were capable of,‚Äù says the band‚Äôs drummer Nathan, ‚Äúwe just had to put our money where our mouths were. We had to take it to the next level. You always want your next record to be better than your last.‚Äù Adds frontman and lyricist Caleb: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never a time that we‚Äôll make a record and won‚Äôt attempt to do something better than what came before.‚ÄùWith its stunning melodies, ringing guitars, and razor-sharp grooves, Only By The Night delivers on the promise Kings of Leon have shown throughout their career. From the desolate atmospherics of the opening track ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù (which Caleb says is about a lovesick vampire) to the emotional intensity of the closing ballad ‚ÄúCold Desert‚Äù (‚Äúabout a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up‚Äù), Only By The Night is all heart from start to finish. Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes.

It was a total spectacle with very nice and loud sound, awesome zoom in the giant screen and the illumination was totally amazing.

They‚Äôve already gone further than anybody could have guessed.‚Äù  Coming as it did on the heels of 2003‚Äôs rowdy Youth and Young Manhood and 2005‚Äôs brawny Aha Shake Heartbreak, the expansive Because of The Times was indeed a pivotal and game-changing album. It led the Followills ‚Äî Tennessee-bred Caleb, Nathan, and Jared, and their cousin Matthew ‚Äî to astonishing success around the world. In the U.S., the band has sold out New York City‚Äôs fabled Radio City Music Hall and The Greek Theatre in Hollywood. In the U.K., Kings of Leon headlined this summer‚Äôs legendary Glastonbury Festival, as well as the Oxygen Festival in Ireland, and sold out their upcoming December show at London‚Äôs 20,000-seat 02  Arena (where Led Zeppelin held its reunion concert) in less than an hour. But if critics thought that Because of The Times was the work of a band ‚Äúat the peak of its powers‚Äù (as the Los Angeles Times put it), they may want to reconsider that assessment after hearing Kings of Leon‚Äôs new album Only By The Night, due from RCA Records on September 23rd. Only By The Night picks up where Because of The Times left off, continuing Kings of Leon‚Äôs shape-shifting evolution and cementing their status as a world-class rock band.‚ÄúAfter three records and touring for five years straight, we knew what we were capable of,‚Äù says the band‚Äôs drummer Nathan, ‚Äúwe just had to put our money where our mouths were. We had to take it to the next level. You always want your next record to be better than your last.‚Äù Adds frontman and lyricist Caleb: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never a time that we‚Äôll make a record and won‚Äôt attempt to do something better than what came before.‚ÄùWith its stunning melodies, ringing guitars, and razor-sharp grooves, Only By The Night delivers on the promise Kings of Leon have shown throughout their career. From the desolate atmospherics of the opening track ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù (which Caleb says is about a lovesick vampire) to the emotional intensity of the closing ballad ‚ÄúCold Desert‚Äù (‚Äúabout a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up‚Äù), Only By The Night is all heart from start to finish. Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes. It was really a big family vibe. That‚Äôs where the title comes from. It‚Äôs also a reference to a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, and it has five syllables, like all of our album titles.‚Äù Caleb had written most of the lyrics and melodies for Only By The Night during some downtime at home recovering from shoulder surgery. ‚ÄúI think the pain pills inspired him a little more than he realized,‚Äù Nathan says with a laugh. ‚ÄúHe would play us a song and we‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòWhen did you write that?‚Äô and he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt really remember writing it.

Young the Giant kept the crowd on their feet and dancing. When Kings of Leon took the stage the crowed was in a frenzy. They opened the show with Supersoaker and played a 2 hour set of 24 songs including Arizona as Denver's 'Song  for the City' and closed with Sex On Fire.

They‚Äôve already gone further than anybody could have guessed.‚Äù  Coming as it did on the heels of 2003‚Äôs rowdy Youth and Young Manhood and 2005‚Äôs brawny Aha Shake Heartbreak, the expansive Because of The Times was indeed a pivotal and game-changing album. It led the Followills ‚Äî Tennessee-bred Caleb, Nathan, and Jared, and their cousin Matthew ‚Äî to astonishing success around the world. In the U.S., the band has sold out New York City‚Äôs fabled Radio City Music Hall and The Greek Theatre in Hollywood. In the U.K., Kings of Leon headlined this summer‚Äôs legendary Glastonbury Festival, as well as the Oxygen Festival in Ireland, and sold out their upcoming December show at London‚Äôs 20,000-seat 02  Arena (where Led Zeppelin held its reunion concert) in less than an hour. But if critics thought that Because of The Times was the work of a band ‚Äúat the peak of its powers‚Äù (as the Los Angeles Times put it), they may want to reconsider that assessment after hearing Kings of Leon‚Äôs new album Only By The Night, due from RCA Records on September 23rd. Only By The Night picks up where Because of The Times left off, continuing Kings of Leon‚Äôs shape-shifting evolution and cementing their status as a world-class rock band.‚ÄúAfter three records and touring for five years straight, we knew what we were capable of,‚Äù says the band‚Äôs drummer Nathan, ‚Äúwe just had to put our money where our mouths were. We had to take it to the next level. You always want your next record to be better than your last.‚Äù Adds frontman and lyricist Caleb: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never a time that we‚Äôll make a record and won‚Äôt attempt to do something better than what came before.‚ÄùWith its stunning melodies, ringing guitars, and razor-sharp grooves, Only By The Night delivers on the promise Kings of Leon have shown throughout their career. From the desolate atmospherics of the opening track ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù (which Caleb says is about a lovesick vampire) to the emotional intensity of the closing ballad ‚ÄúCold Desert‚Äù (‚Äúabout a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up‚Äù), Only By The Night is all heart from start to finish. Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes.

They‚Äôve already gone further than anybody could have guessed.‚Äù  Coming as it did on the heels of 2003‚Äôs rowdy Youth and Young Manhood and 2005‚Äôs brawny Aha Shake Heartbreak, the expansive Because of The Times was indeed a pivotal and game-changing album. It led the Followills ‚Äî Tennessee-bred Caleb, Nathan, and Jared, and their cousin Matthew ‚Äî to astonishing success around the world. In the U.S., the band has sold out New York City‚Äôs fabled Radio City Music Hall and The Greek Theatre in Hollywood. In the U.K., Kings of Leon headlined this summer‚Äôs legendary Glastonbury Festival, as well as the Oxygen Festival in Ireland, and sold out their upcoming December show at London‚Äôs 20,000-seat 02  Arena (where Led Zeppelin held its reunion concert) in less than an hour. But if critics thought that Because of The Times was the work of a band ‚Äúat the peak of its powers‚Äù (as the Los Angeles Times put it), they may want to reconsider that assessment after hearing Kings of Leon‚Äôs new album Only By The Night, due from RCA Records on September 23rd. Only By The Night picks up where Because of The Times left off, continuing Kings of Leon‚Äôs shape-shifting evolution and cementing their status as a world-class rock band.‚ÄúAfter three records and touring for five years straight, we knew what we were capable of,‚Äù says the band‚Äôs drummer Nathan, ‚Äúwe just had to put our money where our mouths were. We had to take it to the next level. You always want your next record to be better than your last.‚Äù Adds frontman and lyricist Caleb: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never a time that we‚Äôll make a record and won‚Äôt attempt to do something better than what came before.‚ÄùWith its stunning melodies, ringing guitars, and razor-sharp grooves, Only By The Night delivers on the promise Kings of Leon have shown throughout their career. From the desolate atmospherics of the opening track ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù (which Caleb says is about a lovesick vampire) to the emotional intensity of the closing ballad ‚ÄúCold Desert‚Äù (‚Äúabout a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up‚Äù), Only By The Night is all heart from start to finish. Album highlights include the insistently chugging first single ‚ÄúSex on Fire‚Äù (‚Äúthere‚Äôs always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I‚Äôd just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,‚Äù Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping ‚ÄúUse Somebody,‚Äù which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being far from home.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the soaring uplift of ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. ‚Äú‚ÄôManhattan‚Äô is actually a Native American word that means ‚Äòisland of many hills,‚Äô‚Äù says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there‚Äôs the driving, forceful ‚ÄúNotion,‚Äù which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. Caleb‚Äôs instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville‚Äôs Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. ‚ÄúAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,‚Äù Nathan says. ‚ÄúHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.‚Äù Petraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.‚Äù Adds Nathan: ‚ÄúYou can tell from the music that we‚Äôre definitely comfortable.‚Äù‚ÄúTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,‚Äù Caleb says. ‚ÄúEvery night after recording we‚Äôd go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes.
